## Trading Floor

This game is done in-person, the software is simply for automatically executing trades.

Every player is a broker who gets their quotas each round and tries to make a deal with the people around them to fulfill that quota.

This software has been used twice, once for 10 people and then for 30 people. It works well with both group sizes, generating an environment similar to a trading floor and making the players feel like brokers. It works better with more people, though, as that makes a more chaotic environment where everyone is making deals that feels like a real trading floor.

## Future Updates

I plan to:
- Stop people from being able to cheat by collaborating.
- Make the UI look nicer
- Make the starting values less random so the best players are more likely to win.
- Make it so it is equally beneficial to be a buyer and a seller.
